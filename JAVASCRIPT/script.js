I started to make large portraits of famous people and really enjoyed it. Soon I wanted to add a little uniqueness to it so I would record myself drawing the portraits with a tablet and after about 9 hours of drawing it would be finished. I would take the finished video and speed it up 64x and add my favorite music to it. The result is the drawings on my YouTube page. I had a great time making them and I hope you enjoy them too! - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFnmswuuNwJNZxlirLT5w9w\" target=\"_blank\">ColeSnyderArt</a>";
